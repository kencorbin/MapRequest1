    Select \"Display Treasure Location\" from settings.\n
    This invokes the Google map app to display\n
    geo:0,0?q=34.99,-106.61(Treasure)\n
    request as documented in\n
    https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-common\n
    \n
    Works properly with Maps version 9.77.5.  Does not work with versions 10.16.7 and 10.27.2\n
    Instead of displaying the "Treasure" label it shows the GPS coordinates twice.\n
    \n
    Still failing with version 10.46.2
